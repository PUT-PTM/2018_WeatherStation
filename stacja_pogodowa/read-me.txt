Overview:
Our project is a project of a weather station, which allows us to measure basic weather conditions (temperature, humidity, pressure). Moreover read data is transmited to mobile phone via bluetooth.

Description:
We used "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" application to check transmited data.

Components:
-BMP180 - pressure and temperature sensor;
-DHT11 - humidity and temperature sensor;
-HC-05 - full-duplex wireless bluetooth module;
-STM32F4DISCOVERY - high performance microcontroller.

How to run:
Read sensors.h header, which has descripted all pins. Plug in pins to the modules. Download bluetooth application terminal. Compile project and flash program into the board. Data will be read autonomously.

Future improvements:
- Graphical application on Android OS, instead of using terminal
- More sensors such as: light sensor, carbon monoxide detector
